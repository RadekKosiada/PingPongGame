      <span>Welcome back to the 90's!</span><br><br>
      <span>Play <strong>ping pong</strong> against the computer.</span><br><br>
      <span>The <strong>left paddel</strong> is yours. Control it with the mouse.</span><br>
      <span>The more diagonal you hit the ball, the more difficult it is for the computer to hit it back.</span><br>
      <span>It's risky, but it's worth it!</span><br>
      <span>The game ends, when one player wins 5 points!</span><br><br>
      <span><strong>Have fun!</strong></span><br>
